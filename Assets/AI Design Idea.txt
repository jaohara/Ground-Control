AI Design for Ground Control
----------------------------

I'm going to need to suss out some ideas for how my main game AI will work so I 
can fully visualize it. 

First thing's first, I'm going to make a "spawn impulse" button, let's 
say that this is going to be something like "i" for right now. When
I press this, the spawner is manually going to carry out one step 
of what it will automate: spawning an enemy.

Before I program it with the enemy, I'm going to need it to calculate where
to plot the enemy path. To represent this in the game I'm going to spawn
spheres one after another to show the paths that the enemy spawner AI
will populate the new enemy's PathController with.
