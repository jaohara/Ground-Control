Ground Control Goals and Objectives Scratchpad
==============================================



InputController Class:
	+ Provide strings for inputs that are used
		- IE string jump = "Jump"; // corresponds to button used in Input Manager

	- Condense all of the input checks from other scripts
		- CheckName (CurrentController) 	-> reports to NewController

		+ JumpCheck (PlayerController) 		-> reports to PlayerController
		+ MoveCheck (PlayerController) 		-> reports to PlayerController
		+ ShieldCheck (PlayerController?) 	-> reports to ShieldController
		+ LookCheck (GunController) 		-> reports to GunController
		+ ShootCheck (Guncontroller) 		-> reports to GunController
		+ BombCheck (***New***) 			-> reports to GunController? BombController?  WeaponController?
		- PauseCheck (***New***)			-> reports to GameController
		+ SpawnCheck (GameController)		-> reports to GameController and PlayerController?

GunController Class:
	+ Why does the first shot on spawn float in the air with no velocity?
		- I think it is related to an object being instantiated before all of other variables
		are assigned a value. I solved this by having a slight delay before the player can 
		fire in start. (5/9/16)

General UI:
	- Make a Local Player UI for little notifications (damage, pickups collected, etc)
	- Make local health bars/bomb or recharge meters?
